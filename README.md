# BashRepo

## Welcome

Welcome to **Dan Good's** public Bash script repository. This collection showcases various Unix/Linux scripts designed to run in the Bash shell.

## Compatibility

- Most scripts should execute on modern Linux distributions, such as **Ubuntu**, running Bash version **5** or later.
- Some scripts may also function on **Mac OS** using Bash **version 3**, though behavior may vary depending on the system environment.

## About `safe_rm`

One notable script in this repository, **safe_rm**, was originally written in **2012** on **Mac OS X Lion (10.7)** using **Bash version 3**. It provides a safer alternative to the traditional `rm` command by emulating a Recycle Bin-like behavior.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a resource for learning and implementing Bash scripting techniques. Feel free to explore, modify, and contribute!
